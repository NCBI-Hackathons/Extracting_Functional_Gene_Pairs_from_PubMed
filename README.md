# Extracting_Functional_Gene_Pairs_from_PubMed

The discovery of biological relationships between genes is one of the keys to understanding the complex functional nature encoded in genomes. Most of the knowledge describing gene relationships can be found in the vast amounts of the biomedical literature. Therefore, tools for automatic exploration of co-occurring gene names in PubMed coud be valuable in gaining knowledge about biological associations. Given a target gene many biological experiments identify a number of genes that change along with the target gene. Additionally, the changed genes could be functionally related to the target gene. Examining pairwise gene relationships manually could be a tedious process. To help with that, we propose a tool which identifies and ranks co-occurring genes in PubMed abstracts.
