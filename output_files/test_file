100002|t|Value and limitations of the electrocardiographic response to exercise in the assessment of patients with coronary artery disease. Controversies in cardiology--II.
100002|a|The results of exercise testing provide a probabibity statement rather than a definitive answer regarding the existence of coronary disease. Moreover, in asymptomatic subjects (1) the S-T segment response to exercise testing has a relatively poor predictive accuracy, (2) exercise testing does not appear to be a practical screening method for detecting subjects at high risk of sudden death, and (3) risk factors should be vigorously treated regardless of the results of screening studies for coronary artery disease. Hence, the probability statements derived from the electrocardiographic response to exercise testing do not appear to provide important enough diagnostic or prognostic information to justify routine use in asymptomatic subjects. Although exercise screening studies provide only marginal aid in detection coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients, important prognostic information may be derived that could influence decisions regarding pharmacologic or surgical therapy. Thus, although electrocardiographic stress testing should not be used as a routine screening procedure, its judicious use in symptomatic patients may provide the physician with important information for patient management.

100012|t|Cellular Cl content and concentration of amphibian skeletal and heart muscle.
100012|a|Toads (Bufo marinus) and frogs (Rana pipiens pipiens) were given intraperitoneal injections of Na36Cl and Na235SO4. After in vivo equilibration for 20--180 min, the animals were pithed, and their ventricular and semitendinosus muscles were excised. Measurements of total Cl (by titrimetry) and 36Cl (by radioassay) showed that specific radioactivities of plasma and mus les approached equality within 1 h after injection for toad skeletal and heart muscle and frog ventricles, indicating complete exchange of cellular Cl with 36Cl. From the simultaneously measured muscle water contents and 35SO4 spaces, intracellular Cl concentrations in vivo (in mumol/g cell water) for semitendinosus and ventricular muscles were calculated to be, respectively, 1.4 +/- 0.3 and 2.3 +/- 0.8 for Bufo and 1.7 +/- 0.7 and 4.8 +/- 2.4 for Rana. In view of these low values, active cellular Cl accumulation seems improbable, but cannot be rigorously excluded without simultaneous membrane potential and intracellular ion activity measurements. A high concentration of Cl in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle is also inconsistent with these measurements.

100013|t|Transplantation of pancreatic beta-cells prevents development of hypothalamic obesity in rats.
100013|a|The present experiments have tested the hypothesis that ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) lesions enhance insulin secretion by neural mechanisms. Rats were made diabetic by injecting streptozotocin to destroy their own pancreatic beta-cells. Subsequently, transplants of fetal pancreatic tissue were placed under the renal capsule. VMH lesions were placed in rats whose diabetes was cured with transplants as well as sham-transplanted animals. The animals were followed for 4 wk. The lesioned rats with pancreatic transplants gained no more weight than the sham-operated controls. There was no significant rise in insulin in the transplanted rats after VMH lesioning, but the VMH lesioned rats with intact pancreatic tissue showed the expected rise in insulin. Food intake rose 71% in the VMH lesioned rats with intact beta-cells, but only 23% in the VMH lesioned rats with transplants. Hypertrophy of the pancreatic islets was also observed in the VMH lesioned rats with an intact pancreas, but was not found in the VMH lesioned rats with a transplanted pancreas. Thus, transplantation of pancreatic tissue beneath the renal capsule of diabetic rats prevented the characteristic hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and obesity in VMH lesioned rats whose pancreas was free from intact innervation. The results support the hypothesis that neural mediation of the rise in insulin is the primary factor in the development of hypothalamic obesity.

100014|t|Regulation of glycogen resynthesis in muscles of rats following exercise.
100014|a|Following a strenuous bout of exercise, glycogen repletion occurred most rapidly in the fast-twitch red type of muscle, least rapidly in fast-twitch white, and at an intermediate rate in slow-twitch red muscle. There was a linear correlation between glycogen synthase I activity and the rate of glycogen synthesis in the three types of muscle. This finding helps explain the differences between the rates of glycogen resynthesis in the three muscle types, and supports the view that glycogen synthase activity is the most important factor determining the rate of glycogen synthesis when substrate supply is adequate. There was an inverse correlation between muscle glycogen concentration and percent glycogen synthase I. Plasma insulin concentration was low and norepinephrine and glucagon concentrations were elevated in the postexercise period. The finding that rapid glycogen synthesis occurred despite a hormonal milieu conducive to glycogenolysis provides evidence that a low glycogen concentration is a potent stimulus to glycogen synthesis that overrides the effects of low insulin, and high norepinephrine and glucagon levels.

100015|a|The relative contributions of light-dark (LD) cycles and feeding (EF) cycles in providing temporal information to the circadian time-keeping system were examined in chair-acclimatized squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). The circadian rhythms of drinking, colonic temperature, urine volume, and urinary potassium excretion were measured with the LD and EF cycles providing either conflicting phases or periods. In conflicting phase experiments, animals were exposed to 24-h LD cycles consisting of 12 h of 600 lx followed by 12 h of less than 1 ls and concurrent 24-h EF cycles in which the animals ate for 3 h and then fasted for 21 h. One group had food available at the beginning and a second group at the end of the light period. In conflicting period experiments, monkeys were exposed to 23-h LD cycles (LD 11.5:11.5) and 24-h EF cycles (EF 3:21). Analysis of the rhythms showed that both phase and period information were conveyed to the drinking and urinary rhythms by the EF cycle, and to the temperature rhythm by the LD cycle.

100018|t|Tetracycline-induced inhibition of Na+ transport in the toad urinary bladder.
100018|a|The effects of three tetracyclines, demethylchlortetracycline (DMC), minocycline (MNC), and oxytetracycline (OTC), on Na+ transport (measured as short-circuit current) were examined in toad urinary bladders mounted in modified Ussing chambers. During a 1-h incubation period serosal DMC (but not MNC or OTC) inhibited basal Na+ transport, whereas MNC (but not DMC or OTC) inhibited ADH-stimulated Na+ transport. MNC also inhibited cyclic AMP-stimulated Na+ transport. During longer incubation periods all three drugs inhibited basal Na+ transport. The DMC-induced inhibition of basal Na+ transport and the MNC-induced inhibition of ADH-stimulated Na+ transport were paralleled by an inhibition of the active conductance of the bladders. Thus, although all three drugs inhibit basal Na+ transport, only MNC inhibits ADH-stimulated Na+ transport. This effect does not correlate with the known effects of the tetracyclines on ADH-stimulated water flow or with drug-protein binding, and may be related to the greater lipid solubility of MNC.

100019|t|Myocardial infarction in the baboon: regional function and the collateral circulation.
100019|a|Occlusion of the anterior descending coronary artery was produced in sedated baboons 7-15 days after implantation of a micromanometer and ultrasonic crystals for measurement of regional left ventricular dimensions in ischemic, marginal, and control segments. One minute after coronary occlusion (CO), ischemic segments exhibited a marked systolic bulge with wall thinning, and percent systolic shortening of marginal segments decreased. Over the ensuing weeks, there was a progressive increase of end-diastolic lengths in marginal and ischemic segments, whereas systolic shortening in these segments did not improve significantly. Control segments did not change. In control baboons, the coronary collateral index was 55 +/-25 (SE) compared to 560 +/- 74 in normal dogs. One month after CO, the collateral index was 543 +/- 144 in baboons compared to 6,685 +/- 716 in dogs, regions of normal tissue were seen in the infarct (14.2 +/- 2% of left ventricular mass). Minimal coronary collateral development in the baboon provides a likely explanation for differences from the dog in regional functional responses and in the character of the infarct.

10002|t|Physical studies on the size and structure of the covalently closed circular chloroplast DNA from higher plants.
10002|a|The size and structure of the covalently closed circular chloroplast DNAs (ctDNA) from pea, lettuce, and spinach plants, have been studied by analytical ultracentrifugation. The values of so20,w,Na+ of the native and denatured forms of the open and closed circular DNAs from these plants have been determined. The absolute molecular weight of purified closed circular pea ctDNA monomers has been determined by buoyant equilibrium sedimentation to be 89.1 (S.D. +/- 0.7)-10(6). The value of the so20,w,Na+ of open circular pea ctDNA and its molecular weight, in conjunction with corresponding values for other sizes of circular DNA, has been used to derive an empirical relationship between so20,w,Na+ and molecular weight for open circular DNAs. Using this relationship, the molecular weights of lettuce and spinach ctDNAs have been determined to be 98.2 (S.D. +/- 1.5)-10(6) and 97.2 (S.D. +/- 1.5)-10(6), respectively. At pH values 12.7 and 13, closed circular lettuce and pea ctDNAs have been found to exist as mixtures of reversibly and irreversibly denatured closed circular DNAs.

100026|t|Inherited metabolic diseases and pathogenesis of mental retardation.
100026|a|Continuing progress has been made in the exploration of the biochemical causes of mental illness. Recent research has indicated that selected abnormalities of specific isoenzymes play an important role in the pathogenesis of heritable metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria and Niemann-Pick disease. The roles of "animal lectins" and glycosidic enzymes in brain development and synaptogenesis appear to have received important substantiation within the past year. In additions, it has been shown that the blood-brain barrier can be temporarily altered so that exogenous enzymes can enter the central nervous system, and imperative consideration for enzyme replacement therapy in mental disorders. Less satisfactory progress has been made concerining potential anabolic disorders of lipids affecting the nervous system. Finally, novel experimental directions concerning energy metabolism by the brain offer considerable hope for the elucidation of some of the causes of mental retardation.

10003|t|Further characterization of a DNA polymerase activity in mouse sperm nuclei.
10003|a|The presence of a nuclear DNA polymerase in mouse sperm from adult testes has been confirmed and the properties of this enzyme further investigated. This activity was shown to be greatly enhanced by treating the spermatozoa with methanol or ethanol before incubation in the reaction medium or by their addition in small amounts to this medium. It was protected against degradation by nuclear proteases by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor and was stimulated by ATP. It was found to be Mg2+ dependent (optimum concentration: 7.5 mM), DNA dependent, and all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates were needed for optimal reaction. The radioactive acid-precipitable product of polymerization was not eliminated by organic solvents, nor by pronase, ribonuclease or by nuclease S1; however, it was converted to a large extent to acid-soluble products by pancreatic deoxyribonuclease. Since it was only partially solubilized by Triton X-100, it therefore did not appear to be preferentially associated with the nuclear membranes. The activity recovered after incubation depended also on the pH (optimum at pH 8.3) and did not work well in a medium for DNA polymerase alpha. The temperature for maximum incorporation of nucleotides was found to be 32 degrees C and, under our conditions, the reaction was linear for 30 min. The DNA polymerase activity was inhibited by low and high concentrations of KCl. It was not lowered by N-ethylmaleimide or p-hydroxymercuribenzoate; urea slightly stimulated the reaction and this stimulation was reversed by subsequent treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. Actinomycin D (40 mug/ml), ethidium bromide (25--50 muM), netropsin (5--50 mug/ml), and spermidine (0.5--2.5 mM) lowered the polymerization of DNA precursors. The nuclear enzyme could shift from the endogenous template to activated exogenous calf thymus DNA, the resulting nuclear radioactivity being reduced. The endogenous DNP template ability was not increased by deoxyribonuclease activation according to the method of Aposhian and Kornberg (J. Biol. Chem. (1962) 237, 519--525) suggesting that the amount of DNA polymerase associated with chromatin was probably limiting the reaction. The DNA polymerase activity detected in mouse sperm nuclei has numerous properties of low molecular weight DNA polymerases (DNA polymerase beta) reported in several eukaryotic organisms.

100033|t|How much will U.S. medicine change in the decade ahead?
100033|a|During the past 12 years health care services have been increasingly used by low-income families, largely as a consequence of infusion of more funds into the health care system. The number of persons employed in health-care has gone up along with an expanded governmental role. Present governmental concerns are focused on cost and the relation of public attitudes to needs for, and costs of, a system of national health insurance. In the near future, medical services are not likely to be expanded, and various costly services may be contracted. The number of physicians will go up but the fraction in solo practice will decline. Patterns of physician maldistribution are not likely to be changed substantially. Costs will continue to go up, and government and other third-party payers will strive to control them. A comprehensive form of national health insurance will not come soon, and the public will become increasingly aware of the limits to which health care can improve their lives.

100034|a|Cannabis produces a resin, the psychotropic effects of which are known since the High Antiquity. It induces euphoria, a feeling of pleasant dreaminess. Nevertheless, psychiatric disturbances such as psychomotor deficiency states or acute oniro  d states were described in heavy users countries. These psychiatric disorders put the accent on the starting or catalysing role of cannabis on the premorbid personality. The experimental studies of cannabis on the premorbid personality. The experimental studies of cannabis and its active substance (delta-g-tetrahydrocanabinol) bring information on this problem.

100035|t|[Results of two methods for testing bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics: disk method and a new semi-automatic method in liquid medium (ABACR procedure) and comparison with the minimal inhibitory concentration (author's transl)].
100035|a|A performance analysis was established between three methods for testing of bacterial susceptibility to sixteen antibiotics: agar dilution or minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, agar diffusion or DISK method, and semi-automatic dilution in liquid medium or ABACR method. Precision of the three methods was determined using three reference strains in repetition experiments (9 repetitions for MIC, 60 repetitions for both DISK and ABAC). The results show that MIC method was the most precise, and that the precision of DISK and ABAC methods was not sifnificantly different. Fidelity of both DISK and ABAC methods was compared in taking as reference the MIC of 200 wild strains of Gram-negative bacteria. Omitting the data concerning trimethoprim-sulfamethozoaxol, the results were found concordant between DISK and MIC methods in 68.6 percent of the cases, between ABAC and MIC methods in 73.6 percent, and between ABAC and DISK methods in 68.9 percent. With regard to MIC, ABAC method gave results slightly better than those of DISK method, especially for five antibiotics: gentamicin, minocyclin, doxycylin, chloramphenicol and polymyxin B. So, the ABAC method looks very interesting for a semi-automatic routine method in testing bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics.

Moreover we have ascertained that those components have the same biological activity as the endotoxins, espcially with regard to their behaviour with B cells of lymphocytes, the results of pyrogen test, the incidence of cycloheximide and their function as inhibitors of bacteriophages. However, it has appeared that chemically they are quite different from the lipopolysaccharide of the Gram-negative bacteria: no lipid A could be detected.

100038|t|Protein-calorie deficits in developing countries.
100038|a|Twenty years ago, we were invited to present a paper on severe protein-malnutrition in children in a meeting organized by this same Academy. In reviewing that paper for this presentation, it was very frustrating to find that the basic principles we stated there in regard to the nature of the probelm and its epidemiology are as valid today as they were 20 years ago. As most other workers in the field, we were then particularly concerned with the severe forms of protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM): kwashiorkor and marasmus. These individual cases occupied a large proportion of pediatric beds in hospitals of most developing countries, and we were interested in finding better ways to treat them. But also we were studying these cases as a basis for understanding the responsible factors better and for designing possible preventive measures. The interrelations of kwashiorkor and marasmus were recognized then, as well the fact that both protein and calories should be considered together in the epidemiology of the problem. We were also beginning to understand that the severe clinical cases that we were seeing in the hospitals were only the visible part of a much greater problem affecting the communities from which these children came. With the knowledge then available on the epidemiology of PCM, we were also starting to explore some specific measures for its prevention. I would like now to review what progress we have made, if any, in the understanding of the nature and magnitude of the problem, its epidemiology, and in designing preventive measures.

10004|t|The rye embryo system as an alternative to the wheat system for protein synthesis in vitro.
10004|a|Isolated rye embryos are a readily available source for the preparation of very active, cell-free, protein-synthesizing systems. Incorporation levels up to 2000 pmol leucine per 50 mul assay are routinely obtained at saturating TMV (Tobacco mosaic virus) RNA concentrations; at limiting messenger RNA concentrations the incorporation exceeds 1000 leucine molecules per TMV RNA molecule. The characteristics of this cell-free system for the translation of TMV RNA are identical with those of a similarly prepared wheat germ system. The major advantage of the rye embryo system is its high reliability as compared to the unpredictable wheat germ system. Sucrose gradient analysis of the reaction mixture during the incubation shows an extensive polysome formation with TMV RNA and demonstrates efficient polypeptide chain release.

100045|a|The activity of N-acetyl galactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase was studied for the first time in the liver and brain of a patient with a clinically typical case of Morquio syndrome with keratosulfaturia. As has been demonstrated in the fibroblasts of patients with this syndrome, this enzymatic activity was markedly decreased in both organs. Neuropathological examination revealed moderately swollen neurons containing PAS-positive, coarse globular inclusions in the cerebral cortex, Ammon's horn, basal ganglia, and thalamic nuclei. Ultrastructurally, the inclusions consisted of stacked, straight or loose, wavy membranes of various lengths, often associated with pale or moderately electron dense homogeneous "lipid droplets." These ultrastructural features of the inclusions were closely similar to the granulomembranous bodies of Hurler syndrome and the inclusions described in type B of the Sanfilippo syndrome. Unlike those mucopolysaccharidoses, however, no abnormalities were found in the gangliosides in the brain of the patient with Morquio syndrome.

100049|t|Effect of a staphylococcin on Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
100049|a|Phage group 2 staphylococcal strain UT0002 contains a large 56S virulence plasmid with genes that code for both exfoliative toxin and a specific staphylococcin termed Bac R(1). Four penicillinase-producing strains and three penicillin-susceptible strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were killed by Bac R(1). After 30 min of growth of the penicillin-resistant TR1 strain in 62.5 arbitrary units of Bac R(1) per ml, loss of viability was approximately 90%, and, after 5 h, an approximately 99.99% loss of viability was observed. Lysis did not accompany cell death, and 84% of the Bac R(1) added to the growth medium was adsorbed to the gonococcal cells. The extracellular supernatant fluid from a substrain of staphylococcal strain UT0002 cured of the plasmid for Bac R(1) production had no lethal effect on the gonococcal strains. Bac R(1) was also shown to have bactericidal activity against an L-form of N. meningitidis, indicating that the outer envelope of a neisserial cell is not needed for bacteriocin activity. Ten different normal human sera were unable to neutralize Bac R(1) activity. The bacteriocin lacks adsorption specificity. It binds to but does not kill Escherichia coli cells, indicating that the cell envelope of gram-negative organisms can provide protection against the staphylococcin.

10005|a|Raman spectra of aqueous solutions of uridine and cytidine have been recorded as a function of pH with the band intensities and vibrational frequencies monitored to determine bands which may be considered as diagnostic of the concentration of the various species. Quantitative band intensity measurements indicate that not all pH-sensitive bands can be considered as diagnostic of the pK value for the acid form of the nucleoside, and for the percent species in solution. Although the accuracy of the Raman band intensity method is inherently less than that of the titrimetric or visible-ultraviolet spectrophotometric methods, the pK values and percent species agree well with those obtained from these methods. The utility of the results obtained from the pH profiles for cytidine is discussed in terms of the effect of acidification on the structural and conformational characteristics of polycytidylic acid in solution.

It was found to be active against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria, including many gentamicin-resistant strains. The spectrum and degree of activity of UK-18892 were similar to those of amikacin, and differences were relatively minor. UK-18892 was about twice as active as amikacin against gentamicin-susceptible strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both amikacin and UK-18892 were equally active against gentamicin-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa. There were no appreciable differences in the activity of UK-18892 and amikacin against Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. Cross-resistance between these two antimicrobials was also apparent.

100057|t|Influence of crossdrafts on the performance of a biological safety cabinet.
100057|a|A biological safety cabinet was tested to determine the effect of crossdrafts (such as those created by normal laboratory activity or ventilation) upon the ability of the cabinet to protect both experiments and investigators. A simple crossdraft, controllable from 50 to 200 feet per min (fpm; 15.24 to 60.96 m/min), was created across the face of the unit. Modifications of standardized procedures involving controlled bacterial aerosol challenges provided stringent test conditions. Results indicated that, as the crossflow velocities exceeded 100 fpm, the ability of the cabinet to protect either experiments or investigators decreased logarithmically with increasing crossdraft speed. Because 100 fpm is an airspeed easily achieved by some air conditioning and heating vents (open windows and doorways may create velocities far in excess of 200 fpm), the proper placement of a biological safety cabinet within the laboratory--away from such disruptive air currents--is essential to satisfactory cabinet performance.

100058|t|Fecal coliform elevated-temperature test: a physiological basis.
100058|a|The physiological basis of the Eijkman elevated-temperature test for differentiating fecal from nonfecal coliforms was investigated. Manometric studies indicated that the inhibitory effect upon growth and metabolism in a nonfecal coliform at 44.5 degrees C involved cellular components common to both aerobic and fermentative metabolism of lactose. Radioactive substrate incorporation experiments implicated cell membrane function as a principal focus for temperature sensitivity at 44.5 degrees C. A temperature increase from 35 to 44.5 degrees C drastically reduced the rates of [14C]glucose uptake in nonfecal coliforms, whereas those of fecal coliforms were essentially unchanged. In addition, relatively low levels of nonfecal coliform beta-galactosidase activity coupled with thermal inactivation of this enzyme at a comparatively low temperature may also inhibit growth and metabolism of nonfecal coliforms at the elevated temperature.

100069|t|Morphology of freeze-etched Treponema refringens (Nichols).
100069|a|The freeze-etch technique was used to study the morphology of Treponema refringens (Nichols). There is a single band of cytoplasmic fibrils which follows a path in the form of a right-handed helix with a periodicity of 1500 nm around the body of the treponeme just below the cytoplasmic membrane. There are two major fracture planes, one located in the interior of the outer envelope and the second in the interior of the cytoplasmic membrane. The "blebs" or "surface protuberances", which are quite prominent in negative-stained preparations, were not evident with freeze-etch preparation, indicating they are not a part of the normal structure of this organism. The outer envelope in untreated cells was observed to closely fit the body of the treponeme, whereas the outer envelope of glutaraldehyde-treated cells had a loose, wrinkled appearance. Thus the "loose-fitting" outer envelope generally described for treponemes is most likely an artifact of preparation for negative-staining and thin-sectioning.

100071|t|Uracil incorporation in the forespore and the mother cell during spore development in Bacillus subtilis. Autoradiographic electron microscopic study.
100071|a|The transcriptional activity of the two genomes of the sporangium during spore formation was determined by pulse-labeling bacteria with 3H-uracil at different times of sporulation and preparing them for high resolution autoradiography. The quantitative analysis of autoradiographs shows that uracile incorporation in the whole sporangium decreases considerably between stages II and IV. However, the variations of the transcriptional activity are not identical in the mother cell and in the forespore. The one of the mother cell decreases rapidly between stages II and III and then remains stable until the end of stage IV, whereas that of the forespore which is low at stage II increases as the forespore grows ovoid and then quickly diminishes. It is very weak at the beginning of stage IV and negligible at the end of this stage. Pulse-chase experiments made in the presence of rifampine indicate that about 30% of the uracile incorporated is located in stable RNA. This value is found at any stage of sporulation in both cellular compartments whatever their rate of uracile incorporation. A relationship can be made between the nuclear shape and the activity of the genetic material. This confirms observations made by several authors in other bacterial species and other physiological conditions that the condensed shape corresponds to a state of low transcriptional activity whereas the more irregular and dispersed shape corresponds to a state of high activity.

100077|t|[Statistical study of the relationships between the etiology and clinical picture of cerebral palsy].
100077|a|846 children with cerebral palsy were examined and 642 were selected for a statistical study by correspondence analysis. The aim was to identify without any prior assumptions, the relationships between the aetiological factors and the clinical findings. The study was completed by conventional statistical analysis of 584 of the cases. Small birth weight and a history of abnormal pregnancies was associated with a cerebral palsy affecting both legs, and often with a squint. Resuscitation was associated with athetosis and abnormalities of posture and behaviour. If the resuscitation lasted for more than 15 minutes or there were certain problems during delivery, severe abnormalities of both arms and major speech difficulties were observed. Resuscitation for less than 15 minutes or for an unknown time or intractable vomiting during pregnancy was associated with quadraplegia. Hemiplegia was related to post natal events but the aetiology was not always known. Foeto-maternal incompatibility was associated with athetosis, deafness, severe speech problems and ophthalmoplegias.

100079|t|Deranged anterior pituitary responsiveness to hypothalamic hormones in depressed patients.
100079|a|Abnormal anterior pituitary (AP) responsiveness to acute administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and luteinizing hormone-follicle stimulating hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) was investigated in 14 patients (two men and 12 women) suffering from primary affective disorders. In ten, TRH, 500 microgram given intravenously, induced a rise in plasma growth hormone (GH) level, while in eight patients it induced a rise in plasma levels of FSH or LH or both. When LH-RH, 150 microgram was administered intravenously to ten patients, it induced a rise in plasma GH level in one patient and increased plasma prolactin level in three patients. Collectively, in only three of 14 patients was conventional AP responsiveness to hypothalamic neurohormones present. These findings demonstrate the existence of a profound derangement of AP responsiveness to hypothalamic neurohormones in depressed patients and suggest that a primary alteration in the physiologic links between the central nervous system and the AP may be at the origin of the neuroendocrine disturbance.

Based on the investigations during the early development it is concluded, that retardation of the fetus is caused by a delayed implantation. It is assumed, that increased resorption is due to kyematopathies detected during the periimplantation period.

100086|t|Impedance audiometry in the squirrel monkey. Sensorineural losses.
100086|a|Acoustic reflex thresholds for pure tones and broad-band noise were measured before and after treatment of nine squirrel monkeys. Experimental sensorineural hearing loss was created in six monkeys by ototoxic drug administration (gentamicin) and in three monkeys by exposure to intense sound. Extent of cochlear damage was assessed histopathologically, in the case of permanent loss induced by the ototoxic agent, and inferred from exposure history, in the case of the reversible loss induced by exposure to intense sound. Posttreatment changes in relationships among acoustic reflex thresholds (noise-tone difference [NTD]) reflected approximate degree of cochlear damage. Serial measurement of changes in the NTD in acoustic reflex thresholds appears to be a worthwhile and useful technique for monitoring sensorineural levels in the squirrel monkey.

100087|t|The terminal zone of the external auditory meatus in a variety of mammals.
100087|a|Standard texts describe the human tympanic recess as a shallow depression. Khanna and Tonndorf (1975) made silicone rubber casts from the auditory meatus of cats and found the recess to be narrow and deep. Guided by this finding, casts were made from 13 different mammals. At the terminal zone of the auditory meatus, profound variations were found, the consequence of three changing parameters: (1) angle between roof of the canal and tympanic membrane; (2) shape of the isthmus; (3) shape of the recess. For all specimens, values were assigned to each of these variables and a composite graph plotted. A reasonably good correlation was found to exist: the larger the angle, the higher and narrower will be the isthmus and the more narrow and deep the recess. The acoustic implications of these findings will be assessed in a separate study.

10009|t|Effect of ionophores A23187 and nigericin on the light-induced redistribution of Mg2+, K+ and H+ across the thylakoid membrane.
10009|a|Passive redistributions of Mg2+ and K+ ions across the thylakoid membranes, occurring in association with the light-driven electrogenic influx of hydrogen ions have been examined in suspensions of broken spinach chloroplasts under a variety of conditions. (i) In accord with results of Hind el al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. (1974) 71, 1484), it was found that at a low K/Mg concentration ratio in the medium, the K-efflux is negligibly small, whereas a substantial Mg-efflux is observed. The converse is true when the K/Mg concentration ratio in the medium is high. (ii) In the presence of A23187, which was found to cause approximately a 60% inhibition of the light-induced pH-gradient, a significant influx of Mg2+ was observed in the light at a high K/Mg concentration ratio. Conversely the Mg-influx was small in the presence of A23187 when the K/Mg concentration ratio in the medium was low. Under these conditions, the Mg-influx was considerably increased upon the addition of valinomycin. A23187 was found not to affect the K-efflux in the light. (iii) The light-induced K-influx observed in the presence of nigericin also was found to be dependent on the concentration ratio of the monovalent and divalent cation. Its magnitude increased upon an increase in the K/Mg ratio. The results are interpreted in terms of a simplified model in which the total passive efflux of cations, driven by the potential set by the electrogenic proton pump, is considered to be a constant fraction of the proton influx. According to this, an increase in the flux of an ion species, induced either by raising its concentration, or by increasing its permeability through the membrane, will cause a decrease in the flux of the other cations. The relevance of the results is discussed with respect to conclusions about the involvement and relative magnitudes of the passive K and Mg effluxes across the thylakoid membrane during energization of intact chloroplasts and chloroplasts in situ.

1001|t|The amino acid sequence of Neurospora NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase. Peptides from digestion with a staphylococcal proteinase.
1001|a|The extracellular proteinase of Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 was used to digest the NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase of Neurospora crassa. Of 35 non-overlapping peptides expected from the glutamate content of the polypeptide chain, 29 were isolated and substantially sequenced. The sequences obtained were valuable in providing overlaps for the alignment of about two-thirds of the sequences found in tryptic peptides [Wootton, J. C., Taylor, J, G., Jackson, A. A., Chambers, G. K. _ Fincham, J. R. S. (1975) Biochem. J. 149, 739-748]. The blocked N-terminal peptide of the protein was isolated. This peptide was sequenced by mass spectrometry, and found to have N-terminal N-acetylserine by Howard R. Morris and Anne Dell, whose results are presented as an Appendix to the main paper. The staphylococcal proteinase showed very high specificity for glutamyl bonds in the NH4HCO3 buffer used. Partial splits of two aspartyl bonds, both Asp-Ile, were probably attributable to the proteinase. No cleavage of glutaminyl or S-carboxymethylcysteinyl bonds was found.

100100|t|Separation of gametocytes of Leucocytozoon smithi from whole peripheral turkey blood.
100100|a|A technique that uses a Ficoll density-gradient system was devised for isolating gametocytes of the parasitic blood protozoan Leucocytozoon smithi from whole turkey blood. Turkey blood containing gametocytes was layered onto a 35% solution of Ficoll and centrifuged. A white band, containing gametocytes and leukocytes, was observed just below the Ficoll-plasma interphase, clearly separated from the underlying packed erythrocytes. The gametocyte-leukocyte suspension was then subjected to a second centrifugation on a continuous gradient of Ficoll ranging from 12% at the top of the tube to 35% at the bottom. The second centrifugation separated the white cells containing the gametocytes into 5 distinct layers: 1) thrombocytes; 2) gametocytes of L. smithi; 3) lymphocytes; 4) a band of monocytes; and 5) granulocytes. Recovered gametocytes, stored at 4 C in a sterile balanced salt solution, retained their morphological integrity for a minimum of 4 weeks.

100102|t|The isolation and partial characterization of the serum lipoproteins and apolipoproteins of the rainbow trout.
100102|a|1. VLD (very-low-density), LD (low-density) and HD (high-density) lipoproteins were isolated from the serum of trout (Salmo gairdneri Richardson). 2. Each lipoprotein class resembled that of the human in immunological reactivity, electrophoretic behaviour and appearance in the electron microscope. Trout LD lipoprotein, however, was of greater density than human LD lipoprotein. 3. The trout lipoproteins have lipid compositions which are similar to those of the corresponding human components, except for their high contents of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids. 4. HD and LD lipoproteins were immunologically non-identical, whereas LD lipoproteins possessed antigenic determinants in common with VLD lipoproteins. 5. VLD and HD lipoproteins each contained at least seven different apoproteins, whereas LD liprotein was composed largely of a single apoprotein which resembled human apolipoprotein B. 6. At least one, and possibly three, apoprotein of trout HD lipoprotein showed features which resemble human apoprotein A-1.7. The broad similarity between the trout and human lipoprotein systems suggests that both arose from common ancestral genes early in evolutionary history.

100103|t|Evidence on the conformation of HeLa-cell 5.8S ribosomal ribonucleic acid from the reaction of specific cytidine residues with sodium bisulphite.
100103|a|The reaction of HeLa-cell 5.8S rRNA with NaHSO3 under conditions in which exposed cytidine residues are deaminated to uridine was studied. It was possible to estimate the reactivities of most of the 46 cytidine residues in the nucleotide sequence by comparing 'fingerprints' of the bisulphite-treated RNA with those of untreated RNA. The findings were consistent with the main features of the secondary-structure model for mammalian 5.85S rRNA proposed by Nazar, Sitz, _ Busch [J. Biol. Chem (1975) 250, 8591--8597]. Five out of six regions that are depicted in the model as single-stranded loops contain cytidine residues that are reactive towards bisulphite at 25 degrees C (the other loop contains no cytidine). The cytidine residue nearest to the 3'-terminus is also reactive. Several cytidines residues that are internally located within proposed double-helical regions show little or no reactivity towards bisulphite, but the cytidine residues of several C.G pairs at the ends of helical regions show some reactivity, and one of the proposed loops appears to contain six nucleotides, rather than the minimum of four suggested by the primary structure. Two cytidine residues that are thought to be 'looped out' by small helix imperfections also show some reactivity.

10012|t|Distinct testicular 17-ketosteroid reductases, one in interstitial tissue and one in seminiferous tubules. Differential modulation by testosterone and metabolites of testosterone.
10012|a|The final step in the biosynthesis of testosterone is the reduction of androstenedione, which is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme 17-ketosteroid reductase. Evidence is presented which suggests that there are two distinct 17-ketosteroid reductases in rat testes, one in interstitial tissue and one in seminiferous tubules. The two enzymes have different pH optima, 5.6 for the one from interstitial tissue and 6.5 for the one from seminiferous tubules. At the optimum pH, a 70-fold difference in Km values was observed, 17 muM for the interstitial tissue enzyme and 0.25 muM for the enzyme from seminiferous tubules. Testosterone and metabolites of testosterone have very different effects of each of these enzyme activities. The interstitial tissue enzyme activity is inhibited by testosterone and several 5alpha-reduced metabolites of testosterone and by estrogens. The most potent inhibitor of the steroids investigated was 5alpha-androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol, followed by 17beta-estradiol approximately equal to dihydrotestosterone greater than testosterone greater than estrone greater than estriol. 5alpha-Androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol and 17beta-estradiol were shown to act by competitive inhibition with apparent Ki values of 2.2 and 3.7 muM, respectively. In contrast, it was demonstrated that among the above steroids, only dihydrotestosterone inhibits the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules and this inhibition was only observed at very high concentrations of inhibitor. Testosterone stimulated the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules. 5alpha-Androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol at low concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity from seminiferous tubules, while it had no effect at high concentrations. The remainder of the steroids tested had no effect on the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules. The difference in response of the two enzyme activities suggests a mechanism for local regulation of testosterone synthesis in each testicular compartment that does not involve directly pituitary gonadotropins.

100121|a|Forty-four subjects with classic or definite rheumatoid arthritis who were on individualized chrysotherapy were observed for changes in serum protein electrophoresis, immunoglobulins, and circulating lymphocyte counts. By paired variate analysis, significant declines from pretreatment values were recorded for the following--electrophoretic protein fractions: gamma, alpha-1, alpha-2, (P less than 0.05); immunoglobulins: IgM--53% (P less than 0.001), IgG--37% (P less than 0.01), IgA--34% (P less than 0.001). Rheumatoid factor decreased in 29 of 39 subjects, 15 becoming seronegative (P less than 0.001); circulating lymphocytes decreased by 27% (P less than 0.001). The maximal suppressive effect on IgG and IgM was not achieved until the third and fourth years of therapy by sustained weekly administration of gold sodium thiomalate (one year cumulative dosage, mean 2106 mg, range 1065-2,885; greater than or equal to 4 year cumulative dosage, mean 8747 mg, range 5,385-15,160 mg). An immunosuppressive effect is suggested by these results.

100122|a|To detail the cost for one year of a chronic disease, 50 patients with Stage III rheumatoid arthritis were surveyed. Direct medical costs for this group were three times the national average, and 58% of these costs were covered by insurance. Indirect costs due to lost income were at least three times the direct medical costs, and transfer payments covered only 42% of these costs. Fifty-eight percent of the study group also sustained a major psychosocial loss. Uncovered income losses were the greatest economic burden for individuals with chronic rheumatoid arthritis. This striking ratio of indirect to direct medical costs has important implications for medical practice and health policy.

100129|t|BRL10833 in inhibiting exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic children.
100129|a|A double-blind controlled exercise challenge study has been performed in 16 asthmatic chlidren to show the effectiveness of BRL10833 in inhibiting exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. The children attended the respiratory laboratory on four occasions within the space of two weeks; on each occassion a routine 6-min exercise test was performed. At the first visit no drugs were given before the exercise test and all the children demonstrated abnormal exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as measured by peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). On the other three occasions the children were given sodium cromoglycate, BRL10833 or placebo medications before the exercise test. After sodium cromoglycate administration four children showed complete blocking and four showed partial blocking of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. After BRL10833 four children showed complete blocking and six showed partial blocking of exercise induced bronchoconstriction. Placebo administration produced complete blocking of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in three and partial blocking in two children. The results indicated that BRL10833 was almost as effective as sodium cromoglycate in inhibiting exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and placebo, although less effective than the two preparations, did afford protection from exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in some of the children.

10013|a|This work reports some enzymatic properties of highly purified horse spleen cathepsin D. Hydrolysis rate of several proteins are compared. The Kinetic constants (Km = 4.95 10(-5) M and Vm = 1,76 delta DO/mn/mug) have been determined in the presence of a denatured haemoglobin substrate. Stability of the enzymatic preparation is discussed according to the pH, concentration and time of storage. Some investigations concerning the active site are described. Enzymatic and chemical results show that dicarboxylic and tryptophanyl residues seem to be involved in the hydrolytic process. Catalysis does not depend on sulfhydryl or seryl residues. Different salts, particularly nitrate, nitrite and polyphosphate are potent inhibitors of enzymatic activity.

100133|a|The amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal 111 residues (variable region) for the light chain of the homogeneous rabbit antipneumococcal type III polysaccharide antibody 3368 was determined. This sequence was obtained principally through automated Edmann degradations of the intact light chain and of peptides generated by tryptic digestion of the citraconylated light chain. With these methods only 2 mumol of purified light chain was required to determine the reported sequence. When compared with the light chains of four other antipneumococcal type III polysaccharide antibodies, the 3368 light chain exhibits a unique sequence in those segments of the variable region that contribute to formation of the antigen binding site (complementarity-determining regions) (10 or 11 residue differences in 12 positions). The 3368 light chain also demonstrates an insertion of three residues relative to the other four light chains in the complementarity-determining region at positions 89 to 98. These five light chains have greater than 80% sequence homology for the portion of the variable region which is not involved in antigen binding (framework).

100139|a|The modes of binding of a new class of impermeant metal-chelating probe, the complex of 111In3+ to 1-(p-benzenediazonium) ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (azo-phenyl-EDTA), to human and rabbit erythrocyte membranes and the effect of binding on the function of rabbit platelets have been studied. The metal chelate, azo-phenyl-EDTA.[111In3+] bound covalently to membrane proteins following reaction with intact erythrocytes. The amount and the pattern of labeling was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide disc and slab gels for radioactivity. The pattern of labeling of intact human erythrocytes by azo-phenyl-EDTA.[111In3+], by pyridoxal phosphate-NaB3H7 and by galactose oxidase-NaB3H4 was also compared. The following results were obtained: (a) The pattern of labeling of intact human erythrocyte by azo-phenyl-EDTA.[111In3+] differed from other commonly used probes for labeling external membrane surfaces. Five polypeptides were labeled by the metal chelates. In addition to the known major proteins (protein band III, PAS-1, PAS-2 and PAS-3 of Fairbanks et al. (1972) Biochemistry 10, 2606--2617) a protein (radioactive band 4) which migrated slightly slower than PAS-3 in SDS gel was labeled heavily by the metal chelate. This protein has an apparent molecular weight of 37,500 in 8.4% acrylamide-SDS gel. About 40% of bound radioactivity was found in this protein. The diazo linkage of the metal chelate to this protein was found to be especially unstable to heat. (b) In rabbit erythrocyte membranes, the metal chelate bound to three polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 96,000, 43,000 and 33,000 in 8.4% acrylamide gel. They are probably glycoproteins in nature. (c) The binding of the probe to platelets did not affect the platelet aggregability induced by adenosine diphoshpate. In vivo studies indicated that the labeled platelets accumulated at the plague of atherosclerotic rabbits. (d) The bifunctional analog of EDTA may permit new applications of metals with useful physical properties for studies of cell membranes.

10014|t|The chemical ecology of Biomphalaria glabrata: the effects of ammonia on the growth rate of juvenile snails.
10014|a|When juvenile specimens of Biomphalaria glabrata were subjected to concentrations of ammonia ranging from 1-100 mug/ml in various media the following effects were observed: the addition of ammonia to borate buffered media caused mortality. Both borate and tris-buffered media caused a decrease in the growth rate of snails when compared with controls in SSW. The growth rates of the snails could be enhanced by increasing the concentration of ammonia to critical thresholds, but further increases beyond these thresholds resulted in growth inhibition. The toxicity of ammonia in ambient water was augmented by an an increase in pH. The possible causation and ecological significance of these effects are discussed. There are indications that the snails are physiologically well-adapted to utilize ammonia when required and also to control its excretion and uptake from the medium.

100143|a|Absorption changes of reaction centers from Rhodospirillum rubrum at 748, 796 and 870 nm induced by 532 and 870 nm picosecond light pulses were investigated with a picosecond spectrometer. Kinetics of absorption changes at 748 and 796 had an additional bleaching when induced by the 532 nm pulse, in comparison with those at 870 nm. The additional bleaching was interpreted as a result of the excitation energy transfer via spectral forms of pigments of reaction centers. The experimental results fit the mathematical simulation of the additional bleaching for the following set of rate constant values: intrinsic conversion to the lowest excited singlet state in bacteriopheophytine molecule--10(13) s-1, energy transfer from bacteriopheophytine to P800 3.10(12) s-1, from P800 to P870--2.10(12) s-1.

100144|a|The rates of formation of a number of metallocarboxypeptidases from metal ions and bovine apocarboxypeptidase A (CPA) have been measured directly and by a competitive method. Rates were determined with pH = 6-8 by utilising the pH change attending metal-ion incorporation, employing indicator and stopped-flow. Second-order rate constants Kf, M-1 s-1 at 25 degrees C, I = 1 M NaCl, pH = 7, Tris = 25 micrometer) were 1.7 X 10(5) (Mn2+), 3 X 10(4) (Co2+), 5 X 10(3) (Ni2+), 7 X 10(5) Zn2+), and 9 X 10(5) (Cd2+). Relative incorporation rate constants were determined at 25 degrees, pH = 7.0, Tris = 0.1 M, by competing two metal ions for a deficiency of apoprotein and analyzing the products by differential enzyme activity. Agreement between the two methods was reasonable. Rate constants for dissociation of CoCPA, NiCPA, and ZnCPA were measured by loss of enzyme activity on addition of the metal ion scavenger EDTA. Values of kd at 25 degrees, I = 1.0 M NaCl, pH = 7.0 were 8 X 10(-3), 3 X 10(-5), and 4 X 10(-4) s(-1), respectively. Values of K obtained kinetically (kf/kd) were in good agreement with those determined by activity measurements of equilibrated solutions. Results are compared with those of bovine apocarbonic anhydrase, where generally significantly slower rates are encountered.

100145|t|Binding affinity of bicarboxylate ions for cobalt (II) bovine carbonic anhydrase.
100145|a|The affinity of bicarboxylate ions (from oxalate to glutarate) for cobalt (II) bovine carbonic anhydrase has been investigated and compared with that of acetate and propionate. The oxalate ion shows a much greater affinity for the enzyme than acetate, whereas the other bicarboxylate ions have very little tendency to bind the enzyme. In every case, and particularly for the oxalate, the apparent affinity constants dramatically increase with decreasing pH. On the basis of the electronic spectra a five-coordinate structure is proposed for all of the above derivatives. Carbon-13 NMR data have been discussed in terms of the oxalate ion chelating the metal ion and/or interacting with the wall of the active cavity.

100146|t|An immunological determination of specific activities of enzymes: its use in quantification of cross reactivity between enzymes of different origins.
100146|a|An immunological method is presented which enables the determination of the specific activity of a pure enzyme without its extensive purification. The method consists essentially in the specific fixation of immunologically related enzymes to an immunoadsorbent containing specific antibodies raised against the wild-type form of the enzyme. We applied this method to determine the specific activity of plasmid-coded beta-galactosidases and to quantify the extent of cross-reaction between these enzymes and Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase.

100149|t|Control of cell multiplication: preparation and immunological comparison of inhibitory factors in the homogenate and perfusate of the adult rat liver.
100149|a|The control of organ cell multiplication by a negative feed-back mechanism implies that factors of the inhibitory mechanism are present in the blood and are produced by the target organ itself. We have examined the inhibitors which are present in the cytosol of adult rat liver as well as in efferent fluid from an isolated perfused organ. These two materials yielded predominantly protein molecules having in common a molecular weight of approximately 80 000 daltons and an isoelectric point between pH 8 and 9. They inhibit both the multiplication of LF hepatoma cells in vitro and the DNA synthesis in the remnant liver following partial hepatectomy in rats. The inhibitors were compared immunologically. When antibodies against the cytosol inhibitor were tested with the Ouchterlong technique against either the original antigen or the inhibitory fraction isolated from the perfusion effluent, a common precipitation line appeared. The inhibitory activity of both the cytosol and the perfusate was neutralized by prior incubation with anti-cytosol antibodies. These results, which strongly suggest a common inhibitor in the cytosol and the perfusate, strongly support the hypothesis of a feed-back mechanism for the control of liver cell proliferation.

10015|a|B-phycoerythrin (B-PhE) from red alga Porphyridium cruentum and C-phycoerythrin (C-PhE) from blue-green alga Nostoc punctiforma were isolated. Their absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured at room and liquid nitrogen temperature. The drastic change of fluorescence and absorption maxima under dissociation of the proteins into subunits was observed. Dissociation of the C-PhE into two subunits (molecular weight 16 000 and 12 000) was revealed by SDS-acrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.01% SDS solution at pH 7.0. The absorption spectra of subunits of both B-PhE and C-PhE were similar. The fluorescence quenching by oxidants and destructive photooxidation were negligible and increased after denaturation.

100151|t|Linkage and gene localization of hereditary spherocytosis (HS).
100151|a|Fifteen kindreds with dominant hereditary spherocytosis (HS) were studied. Expansion of the data from a family with an 8/12 translocation provided further evidence that at least one locus for HS is located near the breakpoint of the translocation. Linkage analysis of all families showed a lack of linkage with all marker loci studied except for Gm (IgG). Linkage between Gm and HS was shown to be significant with a maximum lod score of 3.42 at a recombination fraction of 22%. No heterogeneity of the recombination fraction was observed either between sexes or between families. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that HS is not a heterogeneous disorder.

100152|t|Purine nucleoside phosphorylase in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
100152|a|Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), the enzyme schematically next to adenosine deaminase in the purine salvage pathway, has been demonstrated cytochemically in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy subjects and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. The enzyme activity is confined to the cytosol. In healthy subjects the majority of lymphocytes are strongly reactive for PNP, whereas the rest are devoid of cytochemically demonstrable activity. The percentage of PNP-positive cells largely corresponds to the number of E rosette-forming cells and is inversely proportional to the number of Ig-bearing cells. In six of seven CLL patients studied only a minor percentage of the lymphocytes showed strong PNP activity, whereas the large majority (88%--98%) possessed trace activity. Such patients have a high number of Ig-bearing cells and a low number of E rosette-forming cells. A different pattern of markers was found in the lymphocytes of the seventh CLL patient: 66% were strongly reactive for PNP, an important number formed E rosettes, and a minor percentage were Ig bearing. These data indicate that PNP can be useful as a "nonmembrane" marker in the differentiation of the B and T cell origin in CLL and deserves to be studied in other lymphoproliferative disorders.

Catalytic properties of immobilized enzyme are studied. Km value and pH-dependency of the enzyme activity are found to be close to those of soluble enzyme, kcat value is 3 times lower at pH 7.0. PH-stability of immobilized peroxidase at 20 degrees C and thermostability of soluble and immobilized peroxidases at pH 7.0 within the temperature range from 20 to 81 degrees C are studied. The stability of peroxidase in PAA gel is found to decrease (in 3 times at 20 degrees C, and in 17 times at 56 degrees C). A mechanism of the effect of PAA gel on catalytic properties and stability of peroxidase is discussed.

100175|a|Rhesus monkeys were trained to fixate a central stimulus and to detect and localize a 50 msec light flash presented 6-80 degrees on either side of the central stimulus. Following large lesions of the superior colliculus, they showed persistent deficits in localizing flashes presented 43-80 degrees from the fixation stimulus. However, they were not consistently impaired when the flashes were presented more centrally, and their performance with peripheral stimuli improved when the stimulus duration was 1 sec. Thus, the superior colliculus appears to be necessary for the localization of brief visual stimuli in the far periphery.
